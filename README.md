## Our Goal

An app that helps to split up the tip. 
User enters the total bill and select the tip and choose the split. As soon as user tap on the calulate button the user is navigated to the result screen and the tip is shown to be split.


## What we will be using

* Creating multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Used UIStepper
